    "Genetic algorithms are one of the tools we can use to apply machine learning to finding good, sometimes even optimal, solutions to problems that have billions of potential solutions. It's biological approach is applied in software to find answers to problems that have really large search spaces by continuously generating cantidate solutions, evaluating how well the solutions fit the desired outcome, and refining the best solutions.\n",
